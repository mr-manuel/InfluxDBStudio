## v0.2.0-beta-1

This is a copy of the [last release](https://github.com/CymaticLabs/InfluxDBStudio/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) from the [forked repository](https://github.com/CymaticLabs/InfluxDBStudio).

### New in this release

* Upgraded InfluxData.Net version to 8.0.1
* Tested with InfluxDB version 1.3.6
* Added a tab context menu when right-clicking with the following options:
  * Close
  * Close All
  * Close All But This

### Fixes

* Empty user and password should work with a default install of InfluxDB
* Passwords which include '#' should work

### Notes

* Important: The assembly version number of the project has changed, this usually invalidates user settings in .NET applications (so for this app settings will be things like the connections you have configured). Your settings should get upgraded automatically, but you should created a backup of your settings just in case using File → Export → Settings. If your settings disappear in this new release you can import them from the exported settings file to avoid having to reenter all of your settings again.
